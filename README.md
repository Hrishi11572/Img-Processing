# Image is Processing is ❤️
This repo has the solutions to my course assignments, but written in a resuable way (Object Oriented Way). The Algorithms, have been implemented in bare bone python(3) 
without much use of libraries wherever possible as guided by my instructor. 

## Contour Following: 
This section has implementations of two different algorithms, the one labelled 2 is the faster one, with a much better time complexity. 

## More Up-Coming: 
As the course progresses, I would be adding a number of other algorithms, as well.
